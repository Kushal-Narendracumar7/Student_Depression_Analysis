# Student Depression Analysis & Power BI Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student depression data and visualizing insights through a Power BI dashboard. The dataset includes various factors affecting students' mental health, such as academic pressure, work pressure, CGPA, sleep duration, and financial stress.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each student.
- **Gender**: Student's gender.
- **Age**: Student's age.
- **City**: The city where the student resides.
- **Profession**: Student's profession (if applicable).
- **Academic Pressure**: Level of academic stress faced by students.
- **Work Pressure**: Level of work-related stress.
- **CGPA**: Student's academic performance.
- **Study Satisfaction**: Satisfaction level with studies.
- **Job Satisfaction**: Satisfaction level with work.
- **Sleep Duration**: Hours of sleep per day.
- **Dietary Habits**: Eating patterns and nutrition habits.
- **Degree**: Student's pursued degree.
- **Suicidal Thoughts**: Whether the student has had suicidal thoughts.
- **Work/Study Hours**: Time spent on work or study daily.
- **Financial Stress**: Impact of financial situation on student life.
- **Family History of Mental Illness**: Whether there's a history of mental illness in the family.
- **Depression**: Indicates if the student is experiencing depression.

## Project Goals
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and correlations in the data.
- Identify key factors contributing to student depression.
- Visualize insights using **Power BI dashboards**.
- Help stakeholders understand and address student mental health issues.

## Power BI Dashboard Features
- **Demographic Breakdown**: Gender, age, and city distribution.
- **Mental Health Indicators**: Depression rates based on different attributes.
- **Academic & Work Impact**: Correlation between academic/work pressure and depression.
- **Sleep & Lifestyle Analysis**: Relationship between sleep duration, dietary habits, and mental health.
- **Financial Stress Analysis**: How financial issues affect students' mental well-being.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and EDA.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation and data visualization.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Kushal-Narendracumar7/Student_Depression_Analysis.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if running Python analysis):
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run the analysis scripts in the `notebooks/` directory.
4. Open the Power BI dashboard file (`.pbix`) to explore visual insights.

## Insights & Findings
- A significant percentage of students experience **academic and financial stress**, impacting their mental health.
- **Sleep deprivation** and **dietary habits** play a crucial role in students' well-being.
- Students with **higher work/study hours** tend to report **lower satisfaction** and **higher depression levels**.

## Conclusion
This analysis aims to raise awareness about student depression and provide actionable insights for educational institutions and policymakers. Addressing these mental health challenges can improve students' academic and personal lives.
